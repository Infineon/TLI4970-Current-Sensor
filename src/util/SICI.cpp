/**
 * SICI.cpp - Part of the library for Arduino to control the TLI4970-D050T4 current sensor.
 *
 * TLI4970 is a high-precision current sensor based on InfineonÂ´s proven Hall technology. 
 * The coreless concept significantly reduces footprint compared with existing solutions. 
 * TLI4970 is an easy-to-use, fully digital solution that does not require external calibration 
 * or additional parts such as A/D converters, 0 pAmps or reference voltage. 
 * 
 * Have a look at the application note/reference manual for more information.
 * 
 * This file uses the OneWire library, originally developed by Jim Studt and many contributors since then.
 * Please have a look at the OneWire library for additional information about the license, copyright, and contributors.
