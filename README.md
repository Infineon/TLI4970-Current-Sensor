Library of Infineon's [TLI4970](https://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/sensor/magnetic-current-sensor/tli4970-d050t4/) current sensor for Arduino.

## Summary
The [TLI4970](https://www.infineon.com/cms/de/product/sensor/magnetic-current-sensor/tli4970-d050t4/) is a high-precision current sensor based on Infineon's proven Hall technology. 
The coreless concept significantly reduces footprint compared with existing solutions. TLI4970 is an easy-to-use, fully digital solution that does not require external calibration or additional parts such as A/D converters, 0 pAmps or reference voltage. It thus significantly reduces overall implementation efforts as well as PCB space and cost.

## Key Features and Benefits
* AC & DC measurement range up to Â±50A
* Highly accurate over temperature range and lifetime (max. 1.0% (0 h), 
* 1.6% (over lifetime) of indicated value)
* Low offset error (max. 25mA)
* High magnetic stray field suppression
* Fast overcurrent detection with configurable threshold
* Galvanic isolation up to 2.5kV max. rated isolation voltage (UL1577)
* 16 bit digital SPI output (13 bit current value)
* Small 7 mm x 7 mm SMD package

## Target Applications
* Photovoltaic and general purpose inverters
* Power supplies (SMPS)
* Battery chargers
* Lighting applications
* Electrical drives

## Hardware
Please find the datasheet of the TLI4970 variant [here](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-TLI4970-D050T4-DS-v01_01-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d4625607bd1301562c43e04f38ad).
